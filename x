I am writing in reply to your advertisement on CN GroupÂ´s site. 

The reason I think you are the best choice for me is that I know you have more than 6 years of experience with trainee programs for junior developers. The second important thing is I would like to continuously improve not only my programming knowledge but also I am interested in your language courses.

My strengths include purposeful and persistence. During the last two years, I devoted myself to education in programming while working full-time and part-time at the same time.

I have a stable need to 'be better than yesterday.'
Within 4years I have had 10 international welding certifications. Most were beyond the requirements jobs I did.

In my free time, I was improving my german vocabulary, either in the form of creating vocabulary lists or translating e.g. videos for the german entertainment channel Lady Kracher.

With time I needed various macros and algorithmization to handle my vocabulary lists. I made my first app and focused deeply on programming. 

I see enormous potential in web development and enjoy working with new technologies.

I speak german and english and dreaming about being able to read my favorite books fluently one day.
